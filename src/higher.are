Amedus Divinity ghost~
the Apparition~
You see a shadowy apparition that is there, and not really there.
~
The only thing you can clearly make out from the ghostly figure is
its face, and even that flickers amongst the hundreds of faces you
have known in your life before it settles to one that you are _sure_
is unknown to you.
 
The face is pale, yet its eyes still sparkle with spirit of a man
whom once wielded power and knowledge beyond the grasp
of most mortals.  The green pupils which once gazed upon 
infinite secrets of Arcane and Spiritual now brim  with sadness 
and sorrow such as to fill you with dark clouds of despair and 
apathy.

Rasep Dh'artep~
Rasep Dh'artep is here, choosing its next victim.
~
A horror bare of any flesh, and composed of bone and sinew stands before
you.  Measuring well over 5 meters tall it towers above the area on its
thick pair of skeletal legs, as its 4 arms swing about ready to bring swift
end to any living being within its reach.  
 
Its skull head is affixed on a torso of bones bristling with spikes as if barbed
wire of bone was wrapped about it.  A pair of dead black eyes seem to gaze around
looking for next victim. While the 4 arms extending from within the skeletal torso
weave about.  The upper pair is affixed with bony scythes, while the lower pair's 
fingers bristle with razor like claws, both look equally deadly and dangerous.
 
It moves with deadly grace and unbelievable speed, as seems to search endlessly for a 
next living thing to consume.  Surprisingly you notice a black cube set writhing its 
forehead, and even from this distance you can read the glowing mark of ownership 
upon its surface: "CALANDRA".

Long silky black hair falls in oceanic tresses to her slender waist.
Her face is painted milky white, with black, pouty lips. Long black
lashes hide dark, and evil eyes. Her body is slim, and well proport-
ioned. She covers herself in long black dresses that are both reveal-
ing and concealing at the same time. Runes are etched into her slim
fingers that end with black painted fingernails. This woman is the gem
of Chaos, and the eternal servant of Shadowspawn, Lord of Chaos.

Elrulyan Devabin is here.
~
Also known as "Moleran's Chosen," Elrulyan Devabin is a fine example of
an elf.  Standing over seven feet tall, the fact that he's only wearing a
loincloth allows most of his body to be revealed in all its glory.  A golden
aura surrounds him, giving a look of strength and great willpower to this
man.  The muscles on his body can be clearly seen, making Elrulyan as
physically fit as any warrior.  All this combined seems to serve as a
display of power, though what power this mortal can have is questionable. 
After all, rumor has it that his parents, the elves Ellikain and Malynne
Devabin, are also mortals.

Surrounded by dark power of The Nameless, a vague humanoid shape

Its mouth is opened in an eternal scream of hate and agony as it
relentlessly struggles against the powers binding it to this plane.
Extending from the revolting prison is a long tubular link of power
leading towards the Pillar of Souls.  It seems to squirm and writhe
with malignant force as tendrils of hair thin shadows shoot out 
towards the shady shape within the shadow sphere.
An agonizing scream ensues and you see a drop of the dark matter
separate itself from Virigoth's soul only to quickly become a 
Shade screaming its first cry of hate.  It turns its empty sockets
towards you as it vanishes.

Looking at the Grimoire you see it is a night-black bound book of
dragonhide, expertly stitched, and containing a series of warding glyphs and
insidious runes of evil.  A leering, blackened skull adorns the cover, and
contained within are a hundred jet black pages of parchment, with malevolent
red runes engraved upon them in blood magic.  You cannot discern exactly
what they make out, for it is in some strange language, yet on the back
inside cover, a small addendum says "Seek out the twelve to release the
One".

[Tahaear Demhand]
(The Ritual of [Demonic?] Exorcism)
The [Demon?] is shackled in the center of the Sevenstar,
each side lit with a candle of a different color to represent
the seven [divine?] forces of reality. Once the ritual is
consecrated, the Circle of Seven can commence. Each canticle
read by a different [consecrator?], and passed clockwise
to the next, until the seventh canticle is read.
If for some reason one of the canticles is misread or
mis-[pronounced?], the entire ceremony must begin again
from the beginning.

Fourth Canticle:

[PAGE 3]
After the first [rite?] is read, the [priest?] 
will recite a consecration. After such, the First
Consecrator will be told to recite the last full
canticle, after which, the ceremony will be complete.

A perfectly smooth stone, sanded and crafted down to perfect detail, is
before your eyes.  Easily the size of a full grown human's hand, this emblem
is small, but has an amazingly accurate crest.  A halfling male stands in
the center of the stone emblem, holding in his right hand a shimmering sword
of brightly shining silver, meanwhile in his left hand, he cradles a newborn
halfling.  A field of pipeweed can be noticed behind him, with seemingly
perfect detail of the said pipeweed etched into the stone.  A small circular
border surrounds this scene, separating the average stone from it's detailed
emblem.

have a single white rose in the center, adding exquisite contrast.  In
either left or right section, a shimmering golden lion of lifelike quality,
made of pure gold sparkle with strength and purity.  The lions are crafted
on top of a dark purple surface, complimenting everything else on this

dust are the words: "Virte Nobilitat"

shimmering golden crown.  Two white roses, shimmering in any source of light
that happens to shine upon them, cross each other on top of the black swan. 
Raised slightly above the surface of the crest, yet subtle enough to give
proper respect to the swan and roses, are the letters "Virte Nobilitat" in
magnificent golden ink.

`7Ancient Mausoleum``~
You stand in an ancient crypt from times forgotten.  The walls are bare
and hewn in from the dark rock which composes the isle.  The floor and all
surfaces are swept clean as if time did not touch this place.  Your eyes are
drawn to a dark column, its surface pulsating with an unholy power filling
you with dread.  Around it more then few skeletons litter the ground, all of
them missing their skulls.  To your west a giant gate stands.  Its surface
scribed with ancient runes, and barely flickering feeble light.  You have a
strange feeling that the runes now hold a mere fraction of the power they
used to have...

`8In the Limbo of Unlife``~
You float through thick Grey mist, your body drained of all vitality
and life.  Your sense of time is lost and all you can do is hold on
to your sanity.  Apparitions and shapes form out of the mist, shades
of begins and identifies, some smiling and some attempting to claw
at you angrily.  Suddenly the Grey mist retreats and you find yourself
with in totally darkness, yet defend by roaring sound of thousands
of whispers, chanting, screaming, and mumbling in tongues unknown to
you.  Yet all this slowly retreats only to leave you in total darkness
with a sense of suffocating evil and power chilling your very soul.
Your eardrums fill with throbbing repetitive sound as all around you
a small fraction of the entity called Nameless manifests itself.
Far above you see a small point of light, and know you could leave 
this place that way if you choose to.
 
Far below you in a swirling vortex of grayness a giant gate seems to 
fade in and out of existence.

`8Before Incandescent Gate``~
You float near a mere flickering outline of a giant gate covered with
intricate runes and designs.  Its shape and form blurs and focuses
into existance as if phasing in and out of reality.  As it comes to

scribed onto its surface.

gate~
Catching hints of details between the Gates cycle of focus and unfocused
you piece together an intricate network of bright lines of power 
which emit light intense enough to force you to avert your eyes.
What is quite intriguing however is that most of those lines have
been stained by black oily matter which seems to glisten in the
light as it ripples oddly.
With the whole gate firmly set in your mind you suddenly notice
four distinctive patterns set in the gate along with a small
inscription in the corner.

`8Krounoi's Dump``~
Your senses are assaulted as you enter this room.  The smell is the
first, most intense thing you notice.  A mixture of sewer gas and rotten
vegetables comes to mind.  Every corner is piled high with bones and rotting
garbage.  The small table in the middle of the room is what appears to be
the only clean surface.  On it rests a jar with a small lizard-like creature
inside it, sleeping.  The bright colors on the walls remind you of a circus
tent; one that has been out in the weather too long.  A smokey fire burns in
the firepit, stinging your eyes.  
~
The inky blackness is almost as palpable as the stench as you struggle
to regain your sense of direction.  Finally, you notice the smallest flicker
of light.  As your eyes adjust, you can see a table with a small jar on it. 
Inside the jar is what can only be described as a tiny Red Dragon, whose
constant flames light the room with a golden red glow.

breath taking beauty.  Everything is still, silent, eternal, unchanging.  It
is as though you don't exist, that your life is but a fleeting instant
before the vastness of time and space.  In this place you have only
yourself, your instant in time, perhaps there is nothing else...

small insects. A feeling of peace and contentment surrounds you, making

`8Within a Dark Lair``~
You find yourself within a cave that is completely void of light, the
darkness almost made palpable by the clinging dankness.  The ceiling is low,
forcing most creatures to crouch within its confines.  Formidable structures
of natural stone are dispersed throughout, some of them serving as pillars
to support the rock above.  These structures are full of various nooks and
cranies, perfect for hiding a stash of gold or a hidden poison needler.  The
usual smattering of dust, droppings, and small rodents that one would expect
to find in such an environment is curiously missing, replaced instead with
an eerie silence and tension.  It is obvious that something contraband
resides here.

Everything is bathed in a soft light whose source is not apparent.
The thick, green grass is very soft beneath your feet, dotted here
and there by sweet smelling flowers. A flock of deer watches you
from the edge of the glade and the trees are home to a myriad of
birds and quite a few squirrels. A small, crystal clear stream
meanders through the grass, making a happy burbling sound. Despite
all this you have the feeling that someone is watching you.

`2The Glade``~
You are standing in a huge glade. Massive trees encircle this
place, their thick, leaf covered branches forming a canopy so 
far above your head you can see clouds drifting by beneath them.
Everything is bathed in a soft light whose source is not apparent.
The thick, green grass is very soft beneath your feet, dotted here
and there by sweet smelling flowers. A flock of deer watches you
from the edge of the glade and the trees are home to a myriad of
birds and quite a few squirrels. A small, crystal clear stream
meanders through the grass, making a happy burbling sound. Despite
all this you have the feeling that someone is watching you.

You stand in a blackened room. Dark shadows play on the walls
about you. A large being is present near you, but you cannot
make out what or whom. You have been called before Shadowspawn,
the Lord of Chaos, Avatar of Death...His room could well seal
your permanent death. You feel it wise to remain silent, and
step very lightly.

`8In the Grand Foyer of the Underworld``~
You stand in a grand foyer. The walls are slate black, and carry a
dull sheen. Large columns of black basalt rock span from floor to
ceiling, supporting a roof well over 4 spans above you. On the wall
tiles around you large black iron spikes just out from every square
foot. On some, skeletal remains still hang, faces contorted in agony.
The hard, black floor stretches across the gymnasium sized foyer,
and shines with a bright polish. On the far side of the room a door
is set in the wall.

You stand in an enourmous marble tiled room. The high ceiling
is carved with large, intrcate arches. Then room is empty, save
a giant Scale in the center of the room. In one side, is a 
flickering flame, and in the other, a solid shadow. Behind the
Scale sits an ornate oak chair. The chair is positioned as if
the sitter could watch the Scale indefinately. A sense of burden
hangs in the air, one of infinite purpose and responsibility.

has accrued on the floor before you. Centered in the middle of
the floor is a seven-pointed star, embedded with pearl tiles.
A faint aura of peace and regret eminates in the air.

`2The Eternal Library``~
Truly the most amazing place you have ever seen in your life, the Eternal
Library holds the wisdom of every generation of mortals to walk Aabahran, of
every race.  Crafted from the living trees themselves, and forming a massive
canopy to prevent rain from touching the treasured tomes and works, the
library used no wood or stone, only the living creatures of Aabahran, its
lifeblood, its children, the plants and trees to create a two hundred foot
enclosure that is nearly twenty stories high.  Created nearly two thousand
years ago by the great elven druids of Ancient Shaszarade, the Eternal
Library houses more knowledge then every mortal library in Aabahran. 
Occasionally a mortal is given access to the tomes, but they are all works
scribed by the Gods of the Heralds themselves as they record time for all
eternity.  Over the centuries, magic, and advances in druidic lore have
strengthened the eternal library to have smaller, sideways growing talwyd
trees to hold all the tomes above the ground itself which has been known to
get damp and cause seepage into the texts.  A hundred small pixies, faeries,
and sprites tend the tomes, making sure they are placed in the right spot,
and generally keeping the things in order.  Truly you are blessed to witness
such.

You stand in the center of a large room that seems to have been created
completely out of granite.  In the center of the room is a small unadorned
table, with a single chair.  Looming before you, so much so that you have to
tilt your head to see the top, is the massive bench of a judge.  The bench
is an extension of the ground, carved completely out of granite as well. 
The only source of light in the entire chamber, is directly above you.  The
light illuminates the entire room well, though being directly beneath it
creates an uncomfortable heat.  Strangely enough, the ground beneath your
feet remains cool, almost unaffected by the heat.  Near the top of the bench
an emblem of an Iron Fist is intricately carved.  A feeling of being on
trial permeates the air, accompanied by the imminence of punishment.

this place, so strong and so complete that one feels little else.  Indeed it
seems as if you are in a dream, and a very pleasant one at that.
  As you continue to gaze thoughtlessly, you begin to feel that you are not
alone...

You stand on the plateau of a surreal mountain top.  Thick white
clouds obscure your view to the ground below.  The ocean of white
extends as far as you can see in all directions.  White light from
an indeterminable source dances over the clouds, sending soft
reflections that seem to concentrate on your location.  Before you
brightly polished silver tiles lead to an abrupt drop-off. This path 
is lined with glowing white statues of warriors in gallant poses.
At the end of this path the cloud banks form a massive thrown that
hovers beyond the precipice.  You feel the righteous call of honor,
valor and courage permeate through your soul.

`8Peikloz's Personal Collection.``~
You find yourself standing in the middle of a magical staircase.  Its
lowest and highest point is unseen.  Both sides of the staircase are made of
bookshelves and seem to be filled with all that Peikloz has collected.  An
intense glow from the magical stones which floats in the air above you. 
Despite the light it gives you are unable to see anything else but darkness
when leaning to see what there is on the side, you find nothing but
darkness.  As you walk in the staircase you shiver from the misty cold air. 
Allthough this place seems lifeless and lonely, you manage to make out a
silent distant voice..

`8The Throne of Steel``~
You are surrounded at every angle by steel. The walls around you, the 
ceiling above you, even the floor that you stand on; all fashioned of flawless
untarnished steel. Lethal, jagged pieces of steel protrude from the floor and 
ceiling like enormous stalagmites and stalactites, some of the latter actually
swinging back and forth like deadly pendulums. The room itself feels very
cold, as if the steel itself was forged to be an instrument of death. Beyond
these fatal obstacles stands a metallic throne, its angles equally as sharp.

`1The Crimson Tribunal``~
Immaculate tapestries and embroidered banners of the Crimson Magistrate
hang all around you in this richly decorated room.  You stand within a
circle made of golden steel that is set into the ground, before a large
pedestal and bench.  The sound of hushed voices echo all around you, and you
hear your name being whispered throughout them.  Through dim light, the
shadows of something moving is seen cast upon the dark red walls around you,
yet nothing would appear to be the source of these odd shadows.  As the
sight finally unfolds before your eyes, you cannot help but feel as if you
are awaiting a trial of some sort.  And the fact you feel like you are being
watched very closely at all times does not help.

`8Overturned Earth``~
Are you dead?  Opening your eyes, you behold what can best be described
as a grave, albeit a large one.  The loamy soil muffles the sound and
amplifies the beats of your own heartbeat into a terrible macabre rythm. 
Despite a lack of torches, the room is illuminated but in a method that only
seems to deepen the existing shadows, and make it more difficult to see. 
But one thing is clear, an overwhelming sensation of despair.  The stench of
death and decay fill your nostrils, sweetened by the heady smell of
overturned earth.  Looking above, the roots of unseen plants dangle from the
ceiling and beneath your feet worms writhe and churn the soil.  In the far
corner, a neatly lain garden is tended, rows of root vegetables clearly
identified by small, wooden signs.

signs~
Small, illustrated, wooden signs have been inserted into the soil, clearly identifying
the vibrant vegetables as turnips.  Ornate, pewter nameplates are hung from delicate
silver chains around the leafy bits of each.  The names, Cyril, Graham, and Peter are
engraved on the signs closest to you.

`8The Great Hall of Apathy``~
You find yourself standing in the middle of a grand hall.  Vaulted
ceilings stretch out far above your head, and ornately carved pillars line
the walls of this immense hall, their intricately formed heads supporting
the roofs obviously great weight.  There are no windows that you can see,
nor any visible light sources, yet the room is bathed in a cold, white
light.  The walls are unadorned hewn stone, as is the floor, save for a
large, featureless stone dias at the far end of the room.  Upon this huge
pedestal stands a throne hewn of dull grey metal, and apholstered in purple
velvet.  The acoustics of this room enhance every sound, regardless of how
minute, and even your heart beat seems to reverberate off of the cold walls.
Behind the throne, upon the wall is a large mithril disc, devoid of decor.

`2A Dark Pass``~
The hazy clouds in the sky never move an inch, dumfounding your tracking
skills and making it quite impossible to navigate.  A very stagnant smell
permeates from the soft mushy ground below, leaving questions as to what
truly lies below your feet.  The air is very thick and humid all around you.
An odd willow tree sits right in the middle, like some sort of a marker for
this room.

`2The Eye of the Demon``~
You appear in a dark room, and naked.  A bright flash of light leaves
translucent outlines in your blackened vision.  A soft rhythmic thumping is
the only noise you hear.  Its speed increases with each sequence, and is no
different than what you would imagine the beating of a slowly dieing heart
to sound like, each urgent pulse a sudden and fading gasp for life.  Slowly
your eyes begin to clear, and the heat begins to become unbearable.  Before
you and around you is a large and mutilated eye..  Its sinewy and bloodshot
veins ripple from the inside.  You are inside.  There is no air here, and
you begin to double up, and silenty asphyxiate.  Though it seems just an
illusion, as it blinks it seems to focus...  As if watching you.  A dark
presence resides here.

mob echo `6             Residual effect! Begone!``
mob echo Then the darkness retreats, leaving the old man wheezing as he leans heavily on his staff.

mob echo ---------------
'Welcome to the wonderful world of OLC. First, I'll run through the
'basics of conduct here on the testport, as well as a few things you
'as builders should know.
mob echo ...
'First, your presence here is a privilege, not a right. There are a
'lot of things that are in-progress here that the main port should
'not know about. This brings me to the act of privacy. Anything that
'is happening here is EYES ONLY. Information you receive here is NOT
'under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES to be divulged to any other party, mud, forum,
'or chat. Failure to adhere to this will result in an immediate removal
'from this port, and possible repercussions on the main port.
mob echo ...
'All work you do here is the express property of the Forsaken Lands, 
'and its administration. Any areas you create here are automatically
'assumed to be the property of The Forsaken Lands (FL), and are not
'transferrable to any other media.
mob echo ...
'Keep in mind that when you are building here, there will be certain
'times that the IMPS are coding, and will not always be here to guide
'you along. Reboots may occur frequently, so SAVE AND SAVE OFTEN! If
'we (The IMPS) are busy coding or building, please try to disturb us as
'little as possible.

mob echo `&LESSON ONE``
mob echo -------------
'OLC stands for ON-LINE-CREATION. It is a process whereby you, (The Builder),
'enteres into the "OLC EDITOR" for the purpose of creating rooms, objects,
'and mobs. We will first cover the basics of ROOM CREATION.
'Before we begin, I will tell you that you are assigned to ONE area, and
'ONE area only! You are only to work on this area that has been assigned to
'you. While you are here, you will be working, not exploring, or testing
'out spells/skills. Most areas are safe from tampering, but if you edit
'an area outside of your own, I will know about it, and it is grounds for
'removal from this port.
~
#30306
'You will be assigned to an AREA by an IMPLEMENTOR. This area will consist
'of a filename (eg. gobvil.are), an area name (eg. The Goblin Village), and
'a set of "Virtual Numbers", or VNUMS. The standard area has 100 VNUMS.
'This basically means that within your area, you have 100 possible rooms,
'100 possible objects, and 100 possible mobiles (mobs). I will explain more
'about this.
~
#30307
'Let us say you have been assigned VNUMS 1000-1099 (100 rooms). This means
'that VNUM 1000 can be a room, an object AND a mob. Any or all of each. Keep
'in mind that you never have to use all available VNUMS in an area, and also
'keep in mind that VNUMS of mobs and/or objects do not have to correspond with
'a particular room. In room 1000, you could have an object of VNUM 1034, and
'a mob of VNUM 1087. (We will cover this in RESETS).
~
#30308
'To create the FIRST room of your area, type the following. <CR> stands for a
'"Carriage Return". Do NOT type <CR> at the end, just press return.
'`6EDIT ROOM CREATE 1000 <CR>``
'This will create room 1000. You will see the following:
mob echo `7[Room 1000]
mob echo [Exits: none]``
'The room will FIRST need a name. You do this by:
'NAME (name of the room, we'll call it Testroom) <CR>
'You will see the following:
mob echo `7Testroom [Room 1000]
mob echo [Exits: none]``
~
#30309
'Then, you type in the DESCRIPTION of the room. This is rather simple to do.
'You simply type:
'`6DESC``
'And you enter a description editor. Keep in mind that good builders use
'colorfully worded room descriptions, that should be ONE paragraph, and
'between 4 and 6 lines long. Line lengths are the same as you would use
'for a character description. Once you are done typing in the description,
'just type "@" on an empty line, and you will exit the editor. Now, type
'LOOK. You will see:
mob echo ...
mob echo `7Testroom [Room 1000]
mob echo     This is a test description we have made. The lines should be no longer
mob echo than this, and keep in mind, that room descriptions automatically indent the
mob echo first line 5 spaces. Watch your spelling and grammar here, and be sure to
mob echo use as much creativity as you have in these descriptions.
mob echo [Exits: none]``
~
#30310
'Also, something of note. If you type 'who' now, you will see a little [OLC]
'tag by your name. This signifies that you are presently INSIDE the OLC
'editor. Any regular MUD commands that you type (ie, n, s, e, w, etc) may
'cause problems, since the editor uses keywords to enter different editors.
'In order to get OUT of the editor, type: 
'`6DONE <CR>``
~
#30311
'Now you are out of the editor. If you 'look', you will see the room you
'have just created. Now that this room is created, to get BACK into the OLC
'editor, just type
'`6EDIT ROOM <CR>``
'This will bring you back into the editor. Each room has many different settable
'flags that can be toggled. We will cover these now. Type:
'`6SHOW <CR>``
'This will give you a brief overview of the current room settings. I will list
'the different flags below, as well as a brief description of what each of them
'does.
~
#30312
mob echo `7 Day Description: What characters see during daylight hours
mob echo Night Description: What characters see during the night hours. This function
mob echo                    is OPTIONAL (and encouraged). To enter the NIGHT DESCRIPTION 
mob echo                    editor, just type NDESC.
mob echo Name:       [The Name of this Room]
mob echo Area:       [   01] The Name of your Area
mob echo Vnum:       [ 1000] The current VNUM of the room you are in.
mob echo Sector:     [swim] Type of SECTOR your are in. For more information, type
mob echo                    "? SECTOR" within the editor to show all possible sectors.
mob echo Watched By: [ ] (Don't worry about this flag for now)
mob echo Room flags: [none] (Type "? ROOM" within the editor to show all room flags.
mob echo Room2 flags: [none] ("Type "? ROOM2" within the editor to show room2 flags.
mob echo Health recovery:[100] (Leave this one alone!)
mob echo Mana recovery  :[100] (Leave this one alone!)
mob echo Temperature:[72] (Temp of the room, not required)
mob echo Cabal:     [0] none (If this is a CABAL, leave it alone)
mob echo Characters: [yourname] Shows the characters currently in the room.
mob echo Objects:    [none] Shows the objects currently in the roomn.``
'Also, the exits (if any) will be listed at the very bottom. We will get to that
'next.
~
#30313
'So, now you have your first room, and any of the ROOM flags you have setup. Most
'are self explanatory, but the best rule of thumb is, if you don't know, ASK FIRST
'before you set any of them. Some can cause very adverse affects in gameplay.
'The only flags you should need to set for now are the SECTOR flags, and the
'ROOM INDOORS flag. Leave the rest alone until you learn more about what they do.
'We will cover more about room flags in LESSON 5.
'Now, we need to make an exit. This is very simple to do, and there are two methods.
'First, we will need to create a room to make our exit TO. So:
'`6EDIT ROOM CREATE 1001 <CR>``
~
#30314
'Now, go ahead and name this room and make a short description for it. Then, GOTO
'1000. This will take you back to the room you were just in. Let's say we want to
'make a door to the north, that leads FROM 1000, TO 1001. Inside room 1000, you type:
'`6NORTH LINK 1001 <CR>``
'You will see, as you 'look' now, an exit that leads NORTH from 1000 to 1001. There
'are several exit flags that can be toggled for this. First, you can do:
'`6NORTH DOOR <CR>``
'This will specify that the north exit is a DOOR. Now, you can do:
'`6NORTH CLOSED <CR>``
'This will mean that the north exit is always closed, unless you open it. You will
'now see a little [Exits: (north)] meaning that the north door is closed. We will
'look into this later, and learn about "locked", once we get into the objects section.
'You can also set an exit name for your door. If you type:
'`6NORTH NAME GATE <CR>``
'When you open the north door, you will see: "You open the gate north of you.
~
#30315
'Keep in mind you can link room in any direction. A good rule of thumb is to take
'a piece of graph paper initially, and 'draw' your area there, with the VNUMS you
'plan to use. That way, it becomes much easier to make links, and you don't run
'the chance of making double links, or incorrect links to rooms. Also, using
''Notepad' to write your room descriptions will make it much easier to just cut
'and paste them in. You can do most of this offline.
'The second method of linking rooms is making ONE WAY exits to the room. Let's
'say I wanted to link 1000 and 1001 together, without a return exit. I would GOTO
'1000, and type:
'`6NORTH ROOM 1001 <CR>``
'This makes it so that I can be in room 1000, go north to room 1001, and not be
'able to return southward to 1000. I will just see [Exits: none] in room 1001.
'This is useful for creating mazes and labyrinths, but keep in mind, if you do
'a link that way, be sure there is an alternate way for the player to get out!
'Doors can be made the same way, using the above method.
~
#30316
'This brings us to the end of LESSON ONE. If you missed anything, just say
''L1', and I will repeat this lesson. LESSON TWO will cover OBJECT creation and
'usage. Just say 'L2' to begin.
