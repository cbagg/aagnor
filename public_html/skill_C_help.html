<BR>Rangers and Invokers have partial control of the elements.  When the weather 
<BR>is poor, they have the ability to call down lightning bolts upon their 
<BR>opponents.  The damage inflicted by this spell is a lightning-based attack, 
<BR>and any significant amount of metal/armor on the target will enhance the 
<BR>effect greatly.

CALM
<BR>Syntax: commune 'calm'
<BR>
<BR>One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the healer and cleric 
<BR>is the calm spell, which attempts to relax any agressive creature and those in 
<BR>combat with the caster.  Successfuly calmed targets will lose any violent urges 
<BR>and in case of mindless creatures stop attacks on the caster's party.  Due to 
<BR>their nature, the Undead are particularly vulnerable to this spell.

CHALLENGE
<BR>Syntax: challenge &lt;character&gt;
<BR>        challenge accept
<BR>        challenge decline
<BR> 
<BR>The challenge command allows a Warmaster to challenge a player of
<BR>their choice, or a player to challenge a Warmaster of their choice.
<BR>Once a challenge is given, the challenged party may accept or refuse
<BR>it.  If accepted the challenging party may not begin combat for 5 hours,
<BR>and the combat between these two players will not be carried through
<BR>to a killing blow. (Much like using "mercy" command)
<BR> 
<BR>Challenge in case of a Warmaster is unique as it is the primary means 
<BR>of judging their ability to progress through Warmaster's ranks.  Any
<BR>challenge which is carried through to the end (win or loss) counts
<BR>towards the Warmaster's promotion in the cabal.  Any decline of a
<BR>challenge counts against it.  Quitting or otherwise avoiding an 
<BR>accepted challenge also counts against promotion.
