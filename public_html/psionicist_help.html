PSIONICIST PSIONICISTS PSI PSIONICS
<BR> 
<BR>The history of the Psi can be traced to one diminutive Gnome by the
<BR>name of Snivelis Bentgear. Blessed with a remarkable intellect he
<BR>quickly ascended to the highest ranks of Invokers. He was renowned 
<BR>for his work on Mana charge theory and his lectures as Dean of the
<BR>Academy on the finer aspects of dispelling. Life for professor 
<BR>Bentgear was going as he had precisely planned, until the jealousy of 
<BR>colleagues lined the pockets of Syndicate. Snivelis was captured and
<BR>delivered to the deepest bowels of the Underdark. His Illithid captors 
<BR>exploited his open mind to enslave him into a simple verbal interpreter 
<BR>to the slave pens of the Hive and the army of Duergar they favored. 
<BR> 
<BR>After a time Snivelis began to dissect the manner in which he was 
<BR>manipulated. He could sense, if not see the waves of telepathy as they 
<BR>manipulated various areas of his brain. The nuance of a simple caress to 
<BR>the frontal lobe to invoke movement, the pin prick to the back for 
<BR>blinding pain.  Soon he realized how much potential there was for 
<BR>greater manipulation of not just others, but of the inanimate as well; the 
<BR>elements, the molecular structure of flesh and more. In a procedure 
<BR>only known to the great masters of the Psionicist guild, Snivelis 
<BR>sacrificed that part of him that held Mystic energy and in so doing 
<BR>strengthened his mind to heights no other in Aabaharn have ever 
<BR>known. Thus was Snivelis freed, and thus was the guild of Psionicist 
<BR>born.
<BR> 
<BR>To be accepted into the secret society of the Psionist one must be of 
<BR>superior intellect and unquestioned masters of their current magical 
<BR>craft. The Psi manipulates mana by drawing their power from their own 
<BR>mind rather than magical incantations from the Mystic energy around 
<BR>them. By doing so they are capable of the most powerful feats of 
<BR>magic ever seen. However, when performed such abilities are lost until 
<BR>properly meditated into memory once more. Meditation is the lifeblood 
<BR>of the Psi and their most coveted of rituals, a time when the mind is at 
<BR>peace and released from all existing spell maintenance. The particular 
<BR>abilities of the Psi are secretive and mysterious. Yet it is rumored that 
<BR>the  Psi can specialize their focus on melee, mental or destructive circles
<BR>of study.
