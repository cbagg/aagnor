CYCLE
<BR> 
<BR>Death is the great beyond.  Once you pass through it's arches,
<BR>never again will you return.  Or will you?  The cycle of life
<BR>is a cycle of death.  From death have you came, and so shall
<BR>you return to it.  There is no avoiding your fate, so why bother
<BR>trying.  You perpetuate the cycle by bringing death to those
<BR>whose time has run out, beit in your eyes, or those of your God.
<BR> 
<BR>Those of the Cycle do not kill out of pure lust or acquisition
<BR>of power.  They do so to reclaim souls to add to the pyre, and
<BR>perpetuate the endless cycle of death and life.  To attempt to
<BR>cheat death is folly, and so long as these people exist, it can
<BR>be most dangerous as well.
