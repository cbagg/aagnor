GREED
<BR>
<BR>Gold, jewels, power, beauty - these words leave a sweet taste of lust in the
<BR>mouth of the being who desires much.  His greed drives him through life,
<BR>seeking appeasement and satisfaction, a slight sate for the want that so
<BR>hungrily consumes him.  A life led by selfish goals and pushed in a
<BR>direction that will better the wealth and prestige of the being that chooses
<BR>to enter the gilded cage of Greed.
