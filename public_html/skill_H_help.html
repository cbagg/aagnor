<BR>the effect, it is known that the affected person may sometimes gain an 
<BR>extra attack in combat, and gain a heightened ability in evading his

<BR>The slow spell decreases the speed and agility of the recipient.  While
<BR>affected by the spell, the victim often looses his ability to attack as
<BR>rapidly as he normally can.  The victim is also hindered in evading his
<BR>opponent's attacks.  However, the spell has a calming effect on the victim 
<BR>which allows him to heal more rapidly, both physically and mentally.

<BR>than many swordsmen are.  Warriors, thieves, rangers, berserkers,

<BR>Sneak may be used when moving (including to sneak by monsters), but has a

<BR>sneaking.  Thieves and ninjas may learn how to hide and sneak.  Monks have
