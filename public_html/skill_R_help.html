RAGE
<BR>Syntax: rage
<BR>
<BR>Berserker, with their rash approach to combat, are known to be overwhelmed 
<BR>by madness during combat.  During this madness, they  are able to withstand 
<BR>more damage than they normally would, and can inflict a massive amount of 
<BR>damage at the same time.  They also have an immense thirst to fight that 
<BR>is only quenched at the death of a victim.  Thus, if his original opponent 
<BR>flees, he would attack the next person he sees.  Once out of this state of 
<BR>madness, the berserker returns to his original state.  He can no longer 
<BR>sustain the extraordinary amount of damage he can before, thus if he had
<BR>withstand more than his regular damage, he would go into shock and pass into 
<BR>unconsciousness.  Only the natural health of a berserker can revive him at 
<BR>this point.  Those that are naturally more healthy, may eventually recover. 
<BR>
<BR>When born, the berserker's rage is onfocused and only offers a small fraction
<BR>of its capability untill the berserker chooses a focus for his deadly tide of
<BR>rage through Path Focus.  At this point his choice will determine the style
<BR>and ability of his rage and further frutition into more skills late in his
<BR>career.

RELAX
<BR>Syntax: relax
<BR>
<BR>While berserkers are known for going into a state of madness, they have also 
<BR>developed an ability to try to compensate their temper.  Relax allows them to
<BR>calm down and snap out of that state of madness.  Unless the berserker has 
<BR>chosen the path of anger it has a very small chance of succeeding, although at
<BR>times, it's worth a try.  Those berserkers at higher ranks and have gathered 
<BR>more experience in their traveling would have a better chance at controlling 
<BR>their madness than those who are young and inexperienced. 
<BR>
<BR>Those berserkers whom are skilled in the path of anger will always relax,
<BR>even during combat (a feat beyond the skill of other paths), and take only 
<BR>a fraction of the timer required for their bretheren
