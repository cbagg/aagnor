ILLITHID ILLITHIDS
<BR>
<BR>Illithids are an evil race of subterranean creatures who are endowed with
<BR>vast mental abilities.  They possess the intelligence and wisdom to
<BR>match almost any other race above or below the surface.  They have been
<BR>known to stun foes with a projected cone of force in combat.  In cases of
<BR>emergencies, Illithids enter a state of shock, in which their body divert
<BR>their mental resources directly into healing for a limited amount of time.
<BR>However, they cannot heal either their body or mind for its duration, and
<BR>therefore this is used only as a last resort to ward off death.  Due to their
<BR>subterranean nature they are vulnerable to light based attacks, while their 
<BR>mental prowess and unnatural metabolism grant them resistance to mental and 
<BR>lighting based spells and attacks.
<BR>
<BR>Illithids cannot wield weapons, but they can parry using an innate skill.
<BR>They have automatic proficiency in several minor spells.
<BR>
<BR>Illithids can be: Necromancer
