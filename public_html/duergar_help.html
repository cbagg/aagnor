DUERGAR DUERGARS
<BR>
<BR>Duergars, or sometimes called Dark-Dwarves, are the evil counter part 
<BR>to their surface cousins, the dwarves.  Much like their cousin dwarves,
<BR>duergars are known to be very healthy.  They share the same magic 
<BR>resistance and vulnerability to drowning, as well as infrared vision.
<BR>But their evil ways have lead them to a life of thief and deceit, making 
<BR>them more dexterous than their dwarf cousin.
<BR>
<BR>Duergars can be the follow classes:
<BR>Warrior, Berserker, Thief, Blademaster and Cleric.
