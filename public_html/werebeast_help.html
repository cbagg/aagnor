WEREBEAST
<BR> 
<BR>In the first age of Aabahran the time of Bloodletting saw the great armies
<BR>of Demons and Undead cut their bloody swath through the lands.  It was also
<BR>during this time that a band of forest dwelling folk whom took up their arms 
<BR>against these unnatural creatures were blessed with extraordinary abilities
<BR>by the gods of Nature.
<BR> 
<BR>Werebeasts are gifted with the ability to exists as man or one of the four
<BR>beats of Tiger, Wolf, Bear or Falcon with which they are blessed randomly
<BR>at birth.  Having mostly normal appearance and attributes in their human
<BR>form, once transformed the werebeast gains the additional traits and powers
<BR>of its beast for the duration of the transformation.  At higher ranks when
<BR>its power's have fully matured, the werebeast gains further specific ability
<BR>dependant on its hidden beast.
<BR>
<BR>Available classes: Ranger, Berserker
