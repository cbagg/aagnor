NEUTRALITY
<BR>
<BR>Law, Order.  Good, Evil.  Extremes that when left unsupervised, wield
<BR>terrible power.  When the balance swings too far to one side, it is your job
<BR>to correct it and weigh them a bit more in favor of the underdog, for when
<BR>one side tips the scales beyond aid, it will end all that is known.  You are
<BR>a servant of the scales, aiding those who are outnumbered.  Or perhaps you
<BR>just serve one thing, yourself.  Regardless of your views, you favor neither
<BR>law nor chaos, light nor darkness.  But one thing is consistent, while you
<BR>walk the lands, the balance shall be maintained, and if need be, defended. 
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>While there are many who serve established moral factions, those who walk
<BR>the Way of Neutrality, serve everything that lay between them all.  They
<BR>live in a gray world, ignoring the boundaries of white and black, casting a
<BR>protective eye into everything.  Should any extreme begin to gain ground
<BR>over the other, neutrality steps in, and rights the numbers, maintaining the
<BR>balance between the two.  But then again, there are simply some who do not
<BR>care about good or evil, order or discord.  And to these, the way of
<BR>neutrality embraces them.  Depending on their mood, their actions lead to
<BR>any of the extremes, but call none of them home.
