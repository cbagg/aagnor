STORM
<BR>
<BR>Storm giants are the most intelligent of giants.  They live in cities 
<BR>built underwater and on the land surrounding bodies of water.  Despite 
<BR>being civilized, however, they are still rough and quick to ire, and 
<BR>their chaotic tendencies have caused them to being dubbed 'Storm' giants 
<BR>by humans.
<BR>
<BR>Like all giants, storm giants have a size advantage over most adventurers,
<BR>and are resistant to physical attacks.  They also share with other giants
<BR>an innate mastery in bash, body slam, and enhanced damage, although their
<BR>slow minds make them vulnerable to mental attacks and spells.  Storm giants
<BR>are uniquely resistant to lightning, and can travel above and below water
<BR>without the aid of a boat, and their natural affinity for watery grounds
<BR>grants them large skill bonus when on water.
<BR>However, storm giants cannot use wooden equipment in their adventures, 
<BR>much as elves shun the touch of iron.  Despite their unpredictability, 
<BR>they are followers of the Light.
<BR>
<BR>Storm giants can be the following classes:
<BR>Warrior, Berserker, Cleric.
