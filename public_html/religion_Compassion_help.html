COMPASSION
<BR>
<BR>You have spent your entire life witnessing first hand the follies of war. 
<BR>The price of conflict.  Bloodied bodies, people on the verge of death from
<BR>horrid ailments, the crazed lunatics whose minds have been poisoned.  You
<BR>have seen all of this, and have sworn to put an end to it.  A divine healer,
<BR>or just a soul bent on mercy, you live your life to save others'.  Yours is
<BR>a gift best given to others, and better still given freely.  
<BR>
<BR>Every war has its casualties, and the campaign against evil is no exception.
<BR>And each day, many succumb to the plagues and diseases spread by those who
<BR>walk the path of death.  Regardless of their outlook on war, those who walk
<BR>this path all have one thing in common: A love for life, and the desire to
<BR>preserve it.  Whether they convert divine energy into blessings of healing
<BR>and life, or are merely a friendly ear to speak to, these souls remain true
<BR>to life, and do their own part to reclaim Aabahran for the cause of Good.
