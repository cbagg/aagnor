FIRE
<BR>
<BR>Fire giants are found in the mountainsides, especially in volcanic wastes.
<BR>Typically living in small villages, they often fight among themselves to
<BR>establish power and ranking within their crude communities.  Fire giants
<BR>are also known to quarrel with goblins and orcs over living space and
<BR>hunting grounds, although they are not smart enough to organize themselves
<BR>to fight full-scale wars.
<BR>
<BR>Like all giants, fire giants have a size advantage over most adventurers,
<BR>and are resistant to physical attacks.  They also share with other giants
<BR>an innate mastery in bash, body slam, and enhanced damage, although their
<BR>slow minds make them vulnerable to mental attacks and spells.  Like their
<BR>name implies, fire giants have adapted themselves to their hot surrounds,
<BR>and are thus resistant to fire, and extremely adept with any weapons made
<BR>of fire, or causing fiery damage.  However, ice attacks are foreign 
<BR>to them, and they are vulnerable to such attacks.  They are naturally evil.
<BR>
<BR>Fire giants can be the following classes:
<BR>Warrior, Cleric, and Berserker.
