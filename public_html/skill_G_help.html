GAG
<BR>Syntax: gag &lt;victim&gt;
<BR>
<BR>An useful addition to the thieves repertoire of underhanded skills, a 
<BR>successfully gagged victim cannot call for help.  Since a thief's
<BR>wonderland is in the city, a cry for help could foil his plans by 
<BR>alerting unwanted officials to the scene.  By applying a gag to an 
<BR>unconscious victim, a master thief can mug his victim without fear 
<BR>of being caught.

GRAPPLE
<BR>Syntax: grapple
<BR>
<BR>Grapple is a skill that ninjas use to hold their opponents.  They 
<BR>utilize their dexterity and quickness to maneuver around their 
<BR>opponents and throw them to the ground, causing their opponents to 
<BR>be temporarily stunned.  Although it does not inflict a great amount 
<BR>of damage, skilled ninjas can use this to their advantage to prevent 
<BR>their prey from fleeing.

GHOUL TOUCH
<BR>Syntax: cast 'ghoul touch' &lt;target&gt;

<BR>Using the negative energy that surrounds them, Necromancers are able to 
<BR>drain strength away from the body of their victim.  Although the necromancer 
<BR>gains no beneficial affects, their victim will begin to move sluggishly. Sapped
<BR>of their strength victims will take longer to perform actions in battle and 
<BR>will also be slower to recover from stunning attacks.

GOLIATH
<BR>Syntax commune Goliath
<BR> 
<BR>The legend speaks of this mighty war-horse as a loyal companion to the great
<BR>Knight Delvyn before his eventual corruption and fall from grace.  To this
<BR>day, those whom are pure of heart and full of valor may call upon this
<BR>mighty steed to carry them upon its back.  Unlike mortal mounts Goliath will
<BR>always stay near its master and never be separated.
