TELEPORT
<BR>Syntax: cast 'teleport'
<BR>Syntax: commune 'teleport'
<BR>
<BR>The teleport spell randomly takes the caster from his current location 
<BR>to another location somewhere else in the realm provided his is not in 
<BR>combat.  This spell is very useful to get away from those who are chasing 
<BR>the caster.  However, it does not guarantee the caster safety.  The caster 
<BR>may end up in a worse predicament then he was.  While the user of this 
<BR>spell has a better chance to avoid unpleasant encounters with increase
<BR>in skill, the random nature of this magic makes no assurances.

TRAPS
<BR>( for description of thief trap skill use "help thief traps")
<BR>
<BR>  Due to the guild of Thieves natural willingness to lend their services
<BR>to anyone with enough gold, the land of Aagnor. has become riddled with
<BR>various devices and traps ranging from harmless to deviously deadly in their
<BR>construction and placement.
<BR>
<BR>SEEING BEFORE DYING
<BR> A trap may be present on any object, or path or door leading from a room, and
<BR>when spotted is represented by <font color=#FF0000>+</font> appearing beside an object, or exit.
<BR>An exit can further be examined or looked at using "examine" or "look".
<BR>
<BR>Your chances to spot a trap before setting it off are mainly decided by
<BR>wisdom, and more reliably by the proficiency in Detect Hidden skill.
<BR>Thieves being quite used to these devices get a bonus towards detection.
<BR>
<BR>DEFUSING
<BR> An object or exit may be checked for traps and defused if one is found
<BR>using the "defuse" command.  If successful the trap will be disarmed and
<BR>destroyed if it was created by another player.
<BR>
<BR>PLAYER TRAPS
<BR>  Most of the traps in the Lands, have been created by the Thief Guild and
<BR>are maintained by them.  Those traps cannot be removed, and will be rearmed
<BR>and reset once every so often by the guild.
<BR>
<BR> The traps set and created by individual players however, once disarmed or
<BR>tripped, are usually removed.  These traps also obey PK ranges and cannot be
<BR>seen, defused, or tripped by those outside of their owner's PK range.
