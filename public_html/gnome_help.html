GNOME GNOMES
<BR> 
<BR>Gnomes are a race of small creatures living in the woodlands of Aabahran,
<BR>or venturing underground in their burrows.  Having roughly human 
<BR>proportions, they are a peaceful lot, and many amuse themselves by 
<BR>dabbling in magic.  Because of their peaceful nature, they have found 
<BR>great knowledge in the ways of the world, and are the wisest of all 
<BR>Aabahran's races.  Gnomes are a contemplative lot, thinking of this and
<BR>that, and due to their daydreaming nature, they are vulnerable to the two
<BR>types of attacks that assault the mind, Charm spells and Mental spells.
<BR> 
<BR>Gnomes can be the following classes:
<BR>Bard, Warrior, Ranger, Thief, Invoker, Battlemage, and Blademaster.
