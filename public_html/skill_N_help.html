NERVE
<BR>Syntax: nerve
<BR>
<BR>Through their extensive training in body control, ninjas have learned the 
<BR>various pressure points on a body.  They use this knowledge against their 
<BR>opponents, pressing on their pressure points in combat, causing them to be 
<BR>temporary weakened.  In order to attempt this maneuver, the ninja has to go 
<BR>dangerously close to the victim, even if the victim is directly their attacks 
<BR>at another, the ninja might still receive a blow from a stray hit.

NEXUS
<BR> 
<BR>The struggle for good and ill has been waged since time began.  And upon
<BR>Aabahran's soil, it still wages on.  But there has been no war so epic
<BR>and grand in scale as the war between the Knight of the Crown and Nexus. 
<BR> 
<BR>Hundreds of years ago, when the world was still young, there spawned a
<BR>legion of undead fighting alongside demonkind.  Their numbers, while small
<BR>had a tremendous impact upon the world and it's residents.  In response to
<BR>this unholy threat, the city-states of Val Miran, Rheydin, and Miruvhor
<BR>created a vast army to battle the legion, and send them back from whence
<BR>they came.  And for many decades the cities fought together, and the end of
<BR>the Legion seemed unavoidable.
<BR> 
<BR>However, the ruler of the Miruvhorian Throne, soon fell in league with
<BR>the armies of death, and succumbed to their wishes, granting them warriors
<BR>to secretly battle the cities to the west.  They watched from the shadows as
<BR>the legion spared their city, and moved on.
<BR> 
<BR>The City of Rheydin, more intent on money and power, withdrew their troops
<BR>and bolstered their own defenses, hoping to fight off the infernal army if
<BR>they dared attack their gates.  They watched from their counting rooms as
<BR>the legion spared their city, and moved on.
<BR> 
<BR>Though many of their number had fallen, the remaining forces of evil were
<BR>far from defeated.  They hid, reorganized, and became what is now known as
<BR>Nexus.  Bent on the eradication of Light, and the enslavement of Aabahran, they
<BR>have made unholy pacts with the denizens of the underworld and the planes of
<BR>Chaos to better strike down their ancient enemies, The Knights of the Crown.
<BR>
<BR>SPECIAL TRAITS:  The hordes of Nexus enter Aabahran through unholy gates.
<BR>This cabal can recruit more armies and do it faster then normal.
<BR>Nexus areas cause slightly more damage with weapons and spells then normal.
