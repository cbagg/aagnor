VAMPIRE VAMPIRES
<BR>
<BR>These creatures of the night have given up their souls to join the legion
<BR>of the undead.  Chosen among dark-knights whom are at the rank Legion
<BR>Knight, they have been granted great powers by the Virigoth to do his 
<BR>bidding.  Through their conversion they have lost the ability to produce 
<BR>their own blood, thus must drain those of others in order satisfy their 
<BR>hunger and thirst.  As a term of the Covenant, vampires can only use their 
<BR>special powers at night and are greatly weaken in the wee hours of the 
<BR>morning.  If burned by the touch of sun they must rest in their coffins in 
<BR>order to regain their strength.  While resting in their coffins vampires 
<BR>regenerate at an incredible rate,  however this also the time when vampires 
<BR>never wake to find the stake through their heart.
