COMBAT
<BR>
<BR>The life of a warrior.  You have been one since you can remember.  Maybe a
<BR>few too many blows to the head, but it is all that you have known.  A weapon
<BR>in your hands is an extension of your anger, a field before you is terrain
<BR>to be exploited to your advantage in an upcoming fray.  Some of these tricks
<BR>and concepts you have learned through formal study, but most of them have
<BR>been gained the hard way; broken bones and periods of unconsciousness.  
<BR>
<BR>Battle tactics, weapon training, and the like are the bread and butter of
<BR>those who walk the Way of Combat.  Warriors without equal, they have fought
<BR>campaigns still remembered, and lived to tell the tale.  But from all the
<BR>death and destruction they have been witness to, they have taken with them
<BR>wisdom and experience; two things invaluable when you live life for and by
<BR>the sword.
