STONE
<BR> 
<BR>Stone giants inhabit the wilderness of Aabahran, and live by using their brute
<BR>strength to crush their prey when they hunt.  However, much as other giants,
<BR>their raw strength makes them very clumsy when it comes to avoiding attacks.
<BR>Stone giants are natural wanderers, and are often found alone in places away
<BR>from crowds.  They are largely ignorant of cities and laws.
<BR> 
<BR>Like all giants, stone giants have a size advantage over most adventurers,
<BR>and are resistant to physical attacks.  They also share with other giants
<BR>an innate mastery in bash, body slam, and enhanced damage, although their
<BR>slow minds make them vulnerable to mental attacks and spells. Having no 
<BR>additonal resistances they also lack any true weaknesses. They are neutral 
<BR>in alignment.
<BR> 
<BR>Stone Giants, unlike the others possess the ability to use boulders as
<BR>thrown weapons in certain types of terrain.
<BR> 
<BR>Stone giants can be the following classes:
<BR>Warrior, Ranger, and Berserker.
