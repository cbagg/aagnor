ELF ELVES
<BR> 
<BR>Elves are slightly taller than humans, but have a much lighter build.
<BR>They lack the strength and stamina of the other races, but are far more
<BR>agile, both in body and mind.  Elves are superb mages and thieves, but
<BR>have at best fair talent as warriors or priests.
<BR> 
<BR>Elves resist charm spells most effectively, due to their magical nature.
<BR>However, they are burned by the touch of iron, and so are barred from
<BR>the use of iron in their adventuring careers.  Elves are notoriously
<BR>hard to spot.  They are adept with the ability to sneak and see in
<BR>the dark.
<BR> 
<BR>Elves can be the follow classes:
<BR>Warrior, Thief, Cleric, Battlemage, Invoker, Ranger, Bard
<BR>Blademaster and Paladin.
