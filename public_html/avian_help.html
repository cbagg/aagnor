AVIAN AVIANS
<BR> 
<BR>Avians are bird like creatures that resemble humans.  They have wings
<BR>that allow them to be in constant flight.  Avians have been known to
<BR>travel great distances without needing a rest.  When they are not in
<BR>flight, avians are able to fold their wings and rest them on their
<BR>backs.  Because of their dependance on the wind for propulsion, they
<BR>have become sensitive to disturbances in wind speed and pressure.
<BR> 
<BR>Avians can be the following classes:
<BR>Warrior, Thief, Ninja, Battlemage, Invoker, Necromancer, Dark-Knight, Bard
<BR>and Blademaster.
