UPPERCUT
<BR>Syntax: Uppercut
<BR>
<BR>Another skill taken straight from the bars, a Bard has the ability to 
<BR>throw such a stunning uppercut that it can knock the jaw of the victim loose.  
<BR>While the jaw is loose, no words can be spoken, nor can spells be chanted.

UNHOLY STRENGTH
<BR>Syntax: cast 'unholy strength'
<BR>        cast 'unholy strength' amplify
<BR>
<BR>Before the rise of guilds in Aabahran, the Eternal Army ruled the lands by
<BR>combining rigorous physical and magical training with a strong central
<BR>leadership that drew from the combined powers of all its members. The
<BR>unholy strength spell is a vestige of that era, before the coming of
<BR>Light shattered the army. It allows dark-knights to draw from their own
<BR>life-force to strengthen themselves physically for a short time. A mana
<BR>upkeep is requires to sustain this state of heightened power.
<BR>
<BR>Casting unholy strength when one is already under its affect increases
<BR>the power of the spell. However, this will also increase its upkeep.
<BR>The spell's physical limit is determined by the level of the caster.
<BR>One can also amplify the effect of the spell to make it last longer,
<BR>but the upkeep will be correspondingly increased as well.
<BR>
<BR>At the end of the unholy strength, or when the dark-knight cannot
<BR>support its upkeep, the caster will feel drained from the effects
<BR>of the spell. Note that it is much more dangerous to enter this state
<BR>from failing the upkeep than when the spell expires naturally.
