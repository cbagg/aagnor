CHAOS
<BR>
<BR>Freedom.  A life devoid of rules, you live according to your own whim, and
<BR>nothing else.  Life is as simple as you wish it to be, or as difficult.  But
<BR>why would anyone want life to be hard?  If that were the case, you would be
<BR>trundling along with the zealots.  You live your life by the day, making no
<BR>plans, and heeding nothing.  There are some that call you crazy.  You do
<BR>what you wish, when you wish.  How is that crazy?  
<BR>
<BR>Those who walk this way hold no delusions about their moral standing.  Their
<BR>behavior is constantly changing, ever altering.  A friendly ear one moment,
<BR>and a angry, bitter scowl the next.  People must choose their words
<BR>carefully when speaking to them, because you never know how they are going
<BR>to react.  There are not many words that can sum up the behavior of one who
<BR>follows this way, but it is often said that the only thing consistant about
<BR>them is that they are not consistant.
