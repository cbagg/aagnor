SLITH SLITHS
<BR> 
<BR>A race of sentient lizard men, sliths make their living as mercenaries to
<BR>others, or adventurers in their own right.  Although they lack the brute
<BR>strength of many others in the warrior profession, they are quick and
<BR>agileon their feet.  They also gain an additional attack in combat, by
<BR>quickly turning to strike or trip with their long tails.  This attack is
<BR>automatic, and gains strength as the slith becomes more experienced.  Able
<BR>to shed their skin as a decoy when they need to flee from their foes they
<BR>can become very defensible if needed.  Since Sliths are cold blooded, they
<BR>are not visible on the infrared spectrum as well as see with infravision. 
<BR>However despite these common traits, there exists three distinct species of
<BR>slith, each possessing their own moral views and alignment.  
<BR> 
<BR>Evil, or Red Sliths possess a second set of eyelids which allow them to
<BR>protect their eyes from kicked dirt.
<BR> 
<BR>Neutral, or Green Sliths, like snakes and other reptiles, can unhinge their
<BR>jaws to swallow corpses whole as a means of nourishment.
<BR> 
<BR>Good, or Blue Sliths, possess controlable pigmentation within their skin,
<BR>allowing them to alter their color, and remain unseen for short periods of
<BR>time.
<BR> 
<BR>Sliths can only join the warrior or thief guild.  Having no ties to others
<BR>of their kind, they have a great deal of choice in their ethos and align.
<BR>Because they are creatures of the wilderness, they have natural proficiency
<BR>in the use of spears.
<BR> 
<BR>Avaliable classes: Warrior, Thief and Blademaster.
