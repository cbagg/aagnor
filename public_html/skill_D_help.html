DEMONFIRE
<BR>Syntax: commune demonfire &lt;target&gt;
<BR>
<BR>Demonfire is a spell learned by the clerics.  Shamans may commune to their gods 
<BR>and either call upon their god to bring down divine wrath from the heavens or 
<BR>to conjure forth demonic spirits of hell to assail upon their victims.  The 
<BR>wrath or the demonic spirits that are called may not be used against those 
<BR>of the same path.  If it is done, the attack will be turned against the one 
<BR>who called forth the divine powers.

<BR>Syntax: double &lt;weapon&gt;
<BR>
<BR>Many professions have the ability to wield weapons using both hands.  
<BR>Warriors however, in their endeavor to develop differing techniques
<BR>stumbled upon the advantage of using only one weapon.  Grasping a weapon
<BR>with both hands allows a warrior to use the weapon with greater stability, 
<BR>obtaining greater control.  While double gripping a weapon, a warrior would 
<BR>be able to do more damage than he/she would using only one hand while making 
<BR>them harder to disarm.  Due to the nature of this technique only certain 
<BR>types of weapon may be gripped with two hands.  Staffs and polearms which 
<BR>already require the use of both hands can still apply this technique to gain 
<BR>greater stability.  Using double grip without a syntax will double grip the 
<BR>weapon you are wielding.  Double with a name and you'll wield the weapon from 
<BR>your inventory to wield and doublegrip. 
<BR>
<BR>Note that while double gripping a weapon you still require the "two handed"
<BR>skill to control your weapon efficiently.
