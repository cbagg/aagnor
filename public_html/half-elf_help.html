HALF-ELF HALF-ELVES
<BR>
<BR>Half-elves are brought about by the merging of elven and human blood.
<BR>Shunned by those of pure elven heritage, half-elves usually choose to
<BR>live among the more tolerating humans.  As a consequence of their mix
<BR>blood, they have inherited a sense of curiosity and creativity from
<BR>their human ancestors, and a love of nature and appeal for the aesthetics
<BR>from their elven blood.  What they lose in strength and stamina, they
<BR>make up in intelligence and agility. Half-elves have also retain the
<BR>ability to see unaided in the dark and are most resistant to the affect
<BR>of charm.  Due to their curiosity, half-elves are also quick to learn
<BR>the skills of their trade.
<BR>
<BR>Half-elves can be the following classes:
<BR>Warrior, Bard, Ranger, Monk, Paladin, Thief, Ninja and Blademaster.
