'ENCHANT ARMOR' 'ENCHANT WEAPON'

<BR>Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' &lt;object&gt;
<BR>
<BR>The enchant armor spell imbues armor with powerful protective magics.  It 
<BR>is not nearly as reliable as enchant weapon, being far more prone to destructive 
<BR>effects.  Each successful enchant increases the protection from the armor, 
<BR>thus deeming the item more powerful than before.
<BR>
<BR>The enchant weapon spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing the power 
<BR>of the weapon.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the weapon grows more 
<BR>and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or destroyed by the magic.  
<BR>Also, every successful enchant renders the weapon more powerful, thus 
<BR>considered higher in rank.

<BR>with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus is very low indeed. Warriors, 
<BR>thieves, rangers, berserkers, ninjas, dark-knights, and paladins may learn to
