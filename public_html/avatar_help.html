AVATAR AVATARS
<BR>
<BR>Avatars are creatures of the light, who fight the evil who engulf
<BR>the lands.  They are the most elite of those who fight for the
<BR>Light. Avatars are messengers of Sirant, and are avenging angels
<BR>of sorts. They are created to battle Chaos with divinity, and are
<BR>the chosen emissaries of the God of Light himself. Granted with
<BR>their path come several strong abilities and enhancements that
<BR>grant them great strength over Demons, and other Darkwalkers.
<BR>
<BR>If you are truly divine in nature, and feel you exemplify the
<BR>true virtues of the light, scribe a well written application to
<BR>Sirant stating your history and which events shaped your life
<BR>to motivate you. Brave souls of any rank are welcome to apply, so
<BR>long as they believe their presence in the lands is worthy of
<BR>this highest honor.
