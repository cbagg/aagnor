CABAL
<BR> 
<BR>WHAT IS A CABAL: 
<BR> 
<BR>A Cabal is an organization of elite individuals which has a specific goal,
<BR>agenda and exotic powers granted to them by the Immortals.  They offer a
<BR>chance for deeper, more advanced role-play, new friends, opportunity to
<BR>ascend in cabal ranks and gain respect, power, and loyalty of their members.
<BR>The Cabals of Aabahran are for the most part, player controlled, from
<BR>inducting new members, to forming alliances or declaring vendettas against
<BR>other cabals.  Your chances for induction and future possibilities in
<BR>them, are dictated solely by your relationship with its members and their
<BR>opinion of you.
<BR> 
<BR>Each Cabal fathers a clan whose ideals are identical of the formal Cabal.
<BR>It is from this clan that the members of the cabal are recruited.  Aspiring
<BR>members join the clans and are selected from the pool by their individual
<BR>worth, which is reflected in Clan Points (CPs).  The members of
<BR>the cabal are expected to maintain close ties with their fledgling clan
<BR> 
<BR><font color=#FF0000>HOW TO APPLY</font>: 
<BR> 
<BR>In order to apply to a Cabal of your choice, first use the "help cabals" 
<BR>and "help &lt;cabal name&gt;" commands to check the general theme, and entrance 
<BR>requirements and make sure you are allowed to join.  When you feel ready, 
<BR>you must then find the Cabal's clan HQ.  Based mostly within the confines
<BR>of the three great city-states, their locations are considered secret and
<BR>not to be divulged.  Part of the application process is locating these
<BR>clans by yourself.
<BR> 
<BR>Once you have located the Clan HQ, a processing fee of 30,000 gold pieces
<BR>is needed to induct you into the Clan.  The clan acts as a recruitment pool
<BR>for the actual cabals, which watch over the members and groom prospective
<BR>inductees for their aspired position.
<BR> 
<BR>During their apprenticeship in the clan, each member has the chance to earn
<BR>clan points by completing various tasks, as well as for excelling in
<BR>roleplaying.  They can also lose Clan Points for failing to display the proper 
<BR>effort.  Clan Points are a measurement of that member's potential worth to the cabal, 
<BR>and inductees are selected according to how many Clan Points they possess.  If you 
<BR>wish to graduate from the clan and become a full member of the cabal, you will need 
<BR>to excel above and beyond your clanmates.
<BR> 
<BR>Once you have been selected for induction by the cabal's Immortal leader,
<BR>you will need to compose a well written, formatted application addressed to
<BR>the cabal name.  The application subject <font color=#FF0000>MUST INCLUDE</font> words "cabal application"
<BR>or it will not be considered.  The members of that cabal will then vote on
<BR>your application, and if successful, you will be inducted into the organization
<BR>at the rank of Inductee(0).
