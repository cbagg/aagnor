SCOURGE
<BR> 
<BR>You have always had a cruel streak.  Inflicting pain upon
<BR>others has always gotten a rise out of you, and as you aged,
<BR>the hatred you have for others has grown with you.  You skill
<BR>passion for inflicing pain is only surpassed by your skill at
<BR>doing it.  You bring pain and death in your wake as you cut a
<BR>bloody swathe through your foes.
<BR> 
<BR>The walkers of this way are as many as those that they prey
<BR>upon.  No caste, race, or creed can claim any majority of them,
<BR>as they come from every religious or financial category that
<BR>exists.  But one thing is consitent among them.  A desire to
<BR>destroy, and the means to do it.
