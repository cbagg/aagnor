FAERIE FAERIES
<BR> 
<BR>Extremely intelligent and extremely fast.  The weakness of the faerie
<BR>lies only in their lack of strength and stamina.  Their spellcasting
<BR>talents are marred only by their inability to use the spells of faerie fire
<BR>and faerie fog which are distrupted by faerie's own magical aura.  For the
<BR>same reasons they are also immune to those spells allowing a faerie to 
<BR>become quite an accomplished thief.  With their superb dexterity and natural 
<BR>flying ability faeries are able to travel the realms with great speed as 
<BR>they glide silently through out the areas.  
<BR> 
<BR>Faeries can be the following classes:
<BR>Invoker, Battlemage, Thief, and Bard.
