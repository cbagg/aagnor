'MAGIC MISSILE'
<BR>Syntax: cast 'magic missile' &lt;target&gt;
<BR>
<BR>The magic missile spell creates a magic missile that the caster may direct
<BR> toward his opponents, inflicting wounds against his opponents.  This spell
<BR> is taught to very young spell students, thus not very powerful in nature. 
<BR>However, the spell does increase in power as the caster rise in ranks, 
<BR>although never reaching to a very feared state.

<BR>cures everyone in the room as well as refreshes them from their journey.  
<BR>clerics and paladins and dark-knights to a very small degree are the only

<BR>
<BR>The invisibility spell makes the affected person invisible to the natural eye.

<BR>invisibility spell would become seen again if he is engaged in combat.  
<BR>
<BR>The mass invis spell makes all the people or creatures in the caster's

<BR>combat while invisible will cease to be invisible.

MEDITATION

<BR>
<BR>This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration

<BR>resting.  Those devoted to casting spells tends to learn to meditate a 
<BR>lot more easily than those who are devoted to physical combat.
<BR>
<BR>Monks must meditate to regain their mental strength, while Psionicists 
<BR>do so in order to memorize their spells.  Both of these classes will tend
<BR>to regain more mental strength when meditating in their temples or guildhalls.

MYSTIC TENDRILS'

<BR>
<BR>It has always been said the lifeblood of a mage is not what courses 
<BR>through his veins, but rather his source of mana - for what is a mage 
<BR>without his powers.  Invokers, being masters of harnessing and 
<BR>channeling energy through their bodies, have developed the ability to 
<BR>compensate for their costly spells by tearing into their physical bodies, 
<BR>sacrificing life blood to regain their invaluable mana.  This is a risky 
<BR>procedure, and be warned, it has been the demise of countless many who've 
<BR>tried to sacrifice it all for the sake of magic.

<BR>
<BR>This spell surrounds the caster with a shield of pure energy.  The shield 
<BR>can help deflect magical damage inflicted by the caster's opponents. However, 
<BR>the upkeep of this spell is very stressful.  The caster would have to put in 
<BR>more mental energy every time a magical attack is directed at him in order 
<BR>to deflect the damage toward him.  The efficiency of the upkeep increases 
<BR>as the caster rise in rank.

<BR>syntax: cast 'meteor swarm'
<BR>A battlemage may call forth to the heavens and summon fiery rocks, guiding them
<BR>towards himself and slamming them down in the vicinity of the room he stands.  
<BR>Since the battlemage has no control over the rocks, they could hit anyone near 
<BR>or no one.  The number and size of the rocks summoned is directly affected by 
<BR>casters rank and power.  While the groupmates of the caster are protected, the
<BR>caster himself is not.  The only known way to prevent damage to the summoner is
<BR>known to battlemages who erect powerfull forcefields to negate the damage.

<BR>
<BR>Once rangers have gained sufficient knowledge of the forest and their 
<BR>inhabitants, they are able to learn a skill called mind link.   This 
<BR>ability allows the ranger to better communicate with the beasts that 
<BR>he has called to his aid.  By exploiting the abilities of these beasts 
<BR>they will be able to better hunt and survive in the realms.  However, 
<BR>since the connection between the ranger and his beast is so strong there 
<BR>might be unforeseen repercussions. 
<BR>
<BR>'Stalk &lt;target&gt;' 
<BR>This allows the raven to fly into the room of the target, and the  
<BR>ranger will be able to see the room through the eyes of the raven.
<BR>
<BR>'Control leopard'  
<BR>This allows the ranger to take over all functions of a leopard, 
<BR>allowing ranger to become leopard.  However, this leaves the body 
<BR>vulnerable and unprotected.  Also, if the ranger does not return to 
<BR>the body within six ticks as shown by the affect of mind link, the 
<BR>body will cease all life support, taking the mind with it.
<BR>
<BR>'Break'  Allows the ranger to return to his body.
<BR>
<BR>With mind link, other animals have extra abilities enabled. Displacer 
<BR>beasts will sacrifice themselves in place of their master while being 
<BR>summoned.  Mammoths will sometimes take hits in place of their master.

<BR>The monkey stance symbolizes the agility and speed of the monkey.  While 
<BR>in this stance, it allows the monk to move twice as quickly during battle.  
<BR>But because they only have half the time to prepare, each attack only 
<BR>does a little more than half the normal damage.  While moving quickly, 
<BR>monks must consume lots of food and water.  Heavy equipment hinders the

<BR>It is rumored that when successful this evil enchantment calls the attention
