DROW DROWS DARK-ELF
<BR>
<BR>Drows are a race of renegade elves who have turned their energy toward
<BR>evil.  They are inherently intelligent but have neglected intellectual
<BR>studies and become very nimble from years of generations of thievery and
<BR>mischief.  Like elves, drows have infravision and can walk unnoticed.
<BR>Drows must stay evil to cast any spells they might know.  Those who
<BR>turn to good are frowned upon.  Drows are burned by the touch of silver
<BR>and mithril.
<BR>
<BR>Drows can be the following classes:
<BR>Warrior, Thief, Ninja, Cleric, Battlemage, Invoker, Necromancer, 
<BR>Blademaster and Dark-Knight.
