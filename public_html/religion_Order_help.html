ORDER
<BR>
<BR>Without law, you are nothing more than the animals.  Slave to Disorder.  Law
<BR>and Order are the only thing that raises us above them, good and evil does
<BR>not matter; all are the same before it.  Ruling with an iron fist or
<BR>creating a civilization that favors neither good nor evil, the law is a tool
<BR>to control, to protect, and to gain.  Use it at your whim, but do not
<BR>falter.  
<BR>
<BR>The world is ripe with disorder.  Order is the shield that protects the
<BR>world's population from destruction.  Before it's blind eye, all are equal. 
<BR>The immoral murderer and the pious preacher; all will benefit, and heed,
<BR>it's guidelines.  It favors nothing, but elevates itself above all.  It
<BR>looks down on none, but is superior to everything else.  It is the only
<BR>thing that matters.  But, just as laws are tools, so shall people use them
<BR>to their advantage.  Many who live the Way of Order know what they may or
<BR>may not be able to get away with, and often corrupt the law to further their
<BR>own goals, be it for good or evil.
