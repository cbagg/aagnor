<A NAME="voodoo"></A><BR></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#c0c0c0">
VOODOO DOLL
<BR>
<BR>The art of voodoo is one practiced by high-level shamans.  The shaman 
<BR>uses black magic to bring harm to their enemies over great distances.
<BR>
<BR>CREATING A DOLL
<BR>To first bring harm to an enemy, the shaman must first make a voodoo doll.  
<BR>To do so, the shaman must choose a target.  Once the target is found, they 
<BR>must create a doll by using the following syntax:  voodoo create &lt;target&gt;.
<BR>
<BR>USING A VOODOO DOLL
<BR>After a voodoo doll is made of the target, the shaman may then use it to 
<BR>bring harm to their target.  The shaman may bring weaken, curse, plague, 
<BR>poison, hex, harm, insomnia, blindness, and enfeeblement onto the victim.  
<BR>To place such a burden, use the following syntax: 
<BR>voodoo place &lt;target&gt; &lt;spell&gt;.
<BR>
<BR>Since this making a doll takes time, many moons may pass before a shaman c
<BR>an make another.  Also dolls are rare, and as such are subject to the rare
<BR>limit of your inventory (one less then your rank divided by 10).
