PURITY
<BR>
<BR>Evil surrounds you.  It is everywhere you look.  The darkness has cast a
<BR>grim shadow over everything you hold dear.  The time has come that something
<BR>is done about it.  Others waste time and energy in talk, or ignoring it
<BR>altogether.  That's why you are different.  Take up arms, and the wicked
<BR>shall fall in piles at your feet.  Let them embrace the death they embody,
<BR>and save Aabahran in the process.  
<BR>
<BR>The Way of Purity sees evil as a cancer and use arms to remove it,
<BR>permanently.  They have sworn their sword arm as the hope of life.  No
<BR>longer standing idle as their world crumbles around them, they have sounded
<BR>the trumpet of war, and raised the standard, charging headlong into the
<BR>fray.  Theirs is a path of war, constant vigilance, for if one ceases to
<BR>swing the sword for but a moment, he allows the darkness to advance.
