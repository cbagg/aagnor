HALFLING HALFLINGS
<BR>
<BR>Halflings are short, generally plump people, very much like small
<BR>humans, averaging 3 and 1/2 feet tall.  Their faces are round and broad
<BR>and often quite florid.  Their hair typically curly and the tops of
<BR>their feet are covered with coarse hair.  Their typical life expectancy
<BR>is approximately 150 years.
<BR>
<BR>Halflings are sturdy and industrious, generally quiet and peaceful.
<BR>Overall they prefer the comforts of home to dangerous adventuring.
<BR>However, though they may never look for adventure, they have a strange
<BR>knack for stumbling across them.  And, more than occasionally,
<BR>adventure finds them.  Because of their lives filled with collecting
<BR>comforts and trinkets, they have the benefit of above average wisdom, a
<BR>result of their life experiences.
<BR>
<BR>Halflings are not forward, but they are observant and conversational if
<BR>in friendly company.  They see wealth only as a means of gaining
<BR>creature comforts, which they love.  Although Halflings are about the
<BR>same height as gnomes, their stout and sturdy build gives them a hearty
<BR>constitution.  And, because of their size and light weight as well as
<BR>their peace loving nature, they've grown amazingly agile and dexterous,
<BR>able to dodge many of the attacks of those who seek to harm them.
<BR>Halflings make excellent thieves, as they seek to avoid direct conflicts
<BR>by relying on their speed and agility to get them out of dangerous
<BR>situations.  They are lacking, however, in strength, due to their small
<BR>size and peaceful lifestyles.
<BR>
<BR>Elves generally like Halflings in a patronizing sort of way.  Dwarves
<BR>cheerfully tolerate them, thinking halflings somewhat soft and harmless.
<BR>Gnomes, although they drink more and eat less, like halflings best,
<BR>feeling them kindred spirits.  Halflings are more open and outgoing than
<BR>any of the above races, so they get along with other races far better.
<BR>
<BR>Halflings can be the following classes: 
<BR>Warrior, Thief, Cleric, Blademaster and Ranger.
