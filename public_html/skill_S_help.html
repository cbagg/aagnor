<BR>
<BR>Vampires hunters throughout the Ages have tried to develop the most

<BR>through the vampire's heart. For those vigilant enough to catch a vampire 
<BR>at their most vulnerable, most were too frightened and fail to drive the 
<BR>stake into the heart.  However, for those steadfast enough to hit their mark, 
<BR>the vampire is dealt a devastating blow sometimes causing it to never wake.
