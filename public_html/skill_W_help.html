WEAKEN
<BR>Syntax: cast 'weaken' &lt;target&gt;
<BR>Syntax: commune 'weaken' &lt;target&gt;
<BR>
<BR>The weaken spell will drastically weaken the victim for several hours.  
<BR>This affect often causes the victim to drop their weapons, due to the 
<BR>lack of strength to hold it.  As the caster rise up in rank, the affect 
<BR>of this spell also becomes stronger, making the strength loss in the 
<BR>victim even more evident.

WRATH

<BR>do not have a firm moral commitment.  One should notice that this potent
<BR>prayer quickly loses its power against those seriously hurt or near death.

<BR>outlaws.
