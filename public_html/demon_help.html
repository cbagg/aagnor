DEMON DEMONS
<BR> 
<BR>In the Fourth Age of Aabahran, the demon Shadowspawn came from the Chaos Rift
<BR>and tore Aabahran and its populace asunder with the screams and torments of
<BR>the Chaos Demons. These vile creatures were unlike any Aabahran had seen.
<BR>They did not speak a language any knew, and their names were so vile and
<BR>repulsive to speak that they were connoted nicknames to describe their
<BR>pleasures. Malice, Agony, Lightbane...Many names used by mortals to 
<BR>describe the pure evil that had been borne into the lands.
<BR> 
<BR>Demons are not living beings, but nor are they dead or undead. They are
<BR>the result of a thousand damned souls intertwined into a single mind.
<BR>Since they are already doomed by the gods they are immune to the curses
<BR>you may attempt to bind them with.  Their horribly disfigured bodies are
<BR>often covered in thick cloths, and they avoid daylight and gatherings,
<BR>often preferring to work underground in the darkness. Having no normal
<BR>spoken dialect, they speak only telepathically augmenting their power
<BR>with magic in order to be heard by others.
<BR> 
<BR>Demons are not born into these realms.  Rather a willing mortal submits
<BR>his body to Shadowspawn, and if found worthy he is taken over by a Demon
<BR>thus becoming one of the unholy race. A tortured mind is often the exact
<BR>catalyst he needs to forge a Demon. If, for some reason, you feel you have
<BR>earned a fate worse that death, and wish to serve as one of these Dark
<BR>Lords, send an application to Immortal with your inquiry. Be warned,
<BR>however...They do not tolerate foolishness. Only the truly blackest
<BR>of hearts will enter into the Demonic Kin. Be wary.
