LORE
<BR>Syntax: lore &lt;object&gt;
<BR>
<BR>Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends.  
<BR>Use of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object, 
<BR>concerning its power and uses.  While those with great intelect and wisdom
<BR>have natural affinity for this skill, a lucky fool has been known to give 
<BR>better readings then a learned Savant.  Bards due to their extensive wordly
<BR>knowledge always get a perfect lore reading.
<BR>When using the lore skill you will get a general idea of the object's 
<BR>origins.

LURE

<BR>fight in privacy.

LEECH
<BR>
<BR>Illithids have gained a special skill, in which they wrap their tentacles
<BR>around the victim's head, and run an electric current through their
<BR>tentacles, penetrating the skull.  Specialized sensors at the tips of the
<BR>tentacles reads the feedback of the electric currents, and if successful
<BR>they are able to steal the victim's memory temporarily.  The memory is not
<BR>lost from the victim.  However, the shock to the head have a chance of
<BR>causing disorientation to the victim. With this skill, Illithids can gain
<BR>temporary proficiency of spells from illusionists, invokers, necromancers,
<BR>and psionicists.  Due to the enormous strain it takes to retain the memory,
<BR>the Illithid will be drained for a short while after the affects have worn
<BR>off.  Only the more experienced Illithids can use this skill.
