FERAL
<BR>
<BR>In the year 368, a group of Miruvhorian refugees were forced to flee into
<BR>the Forsaken Lands.  These men and women, driven by the instinct of
<BR>survival, managed to make their home within those lands for some time. 
<BR>However, as time went on, their minds were tainted and their bodies ravaged
<BR>by the influence of Chaos in the corrupted land on which they lived. They 
<BR>began to crouch low as their bodies attuned to the wild and some grew claws 
<BR>with which  to defend themselves. Their senses were empowered tremendously 
<BR>even as fur covered their skin and their features grew more beastly then
<BR>human.  Fire, being once a tool necessary for survival, became their greatest 
<BR>fear.
<BR>
<BR>The feral, as they have become known, emerged from the Forsaken Lands a
<BR>rugged and forever changed people.  They are extremely fast, strong and 
<BR>tough, and their need of survival has attuned their natural reflexes to the 
<BR>extreme. Being the product of corruption and tainted means, the natural world 
<BR>rejected them.  They in turn rejected the civilized world and the rules 
<BR>imposed upon it.  Living in an extremely harsh environment, their outlook on 
<BR>life is much the same.  Kindness and goodness are a foreign concept to their 
<BR>necessities of life.  The feral are truly the forsaken people of Aabahran.  
<BR>
<BR>Feral can be the following classes: 
<BR>Warrior, Ranger, Thief, Ninja, Blademaster, Cleric, and Shaman
