HELP UNDEAD UNLIFE
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>   With the release of the ancient forces of death from its
<BR>   prison in Pillar of Souls by Virigoth, the forces of Undead
<BR>   have once again begun their never ending war on the living.
<BR>
<BR>   During the Coming when forces of Chaos brought terror unto 
<BR>   all Aabahran, with rebirth of Virigoth the ancient undead were
<BR>   said to all but raise in legions from under the ground and
<BR>   forgotten crypts. Yet those times are but history now and
<BR>   stories of terrible savants of night called Vampires, and 
<BR>   the infernal archmages of death the Liches are but stories
<BR>   used to scare the younglings.
<BR>
<BR>   Yet even now rumors carry news of an ancient hidden cult in 
<BR>   the name of the Lord of Unlife. And sometimes, only rarely a 
<BR>   brief tale of some strange occurrence surfaces in the taverns
<BR>   telling of horrible beings seen on night roads of Aabahran.
<BR>
<BR>   It is not without cause that the graveyards of Aabahran are 
<BR>   marked with the Snarling Skull for protection. As for all 
<BR>   the ignorance the wise know that the undead minions of 
<BR>   Virigoth, chosen among mortals for their loyalty and power 
<BR>   travel the roads at night fulfilling Its will in Aabahran.
