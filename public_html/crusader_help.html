CRUSADER
<BR>
<BR>  Trained by the Order of Crusades these mighty men and women of the
<BR>One God, travel through Aabahran helping those in need, avenging
<BR>wrongs done, and Crusading against those whom would seek to harm the less
<BR>fortunate.  Honor, Valor and above all Modesty are their virtues,
<BR>requiring a Crusader to act as priests first then warriors, without the
<BR>easy miracles of common deities.
<BR>
<BR>  Crusaders are warriors who have chosen to use Faith as the focus for their
<BR>skills, at times honing them to such degree that their feats all but
<BR>surpass the mortal realm.  As they progress through ranks they are offered
<BR>choices in skills, these choices in turn affecting what other skills they
<BR>will have available in future.  The end result of this process is that no
<BR>two Crusaders are alike, as the choices they make often drastically affect
<BR>the things they may excel or do poorly in.
<BR>
<BR>  Rejecting delicate and non direct methods of combat, they relay upon brutal
<BR>combination of skill and strength combined with legendary arts of weaponcraft 
<BR>and armorcraft which allows them to excel in combat against single or multiple
<BR>opponents.  Experts of two handed weapons, they never use shields relying
<BR>instead on armors so thick and heavy that legends have been sung about
<BR>their ability to wade through battle unharmed by blows of ordinary blades.
<BR>They carry weapons consecrated to their god which increase in power as the
<BR>Crusader fulfills his duties to the Order.  These holy weapons seem to 
<BR>withstand the most brutal of modifications and many a foe has been brought
<BR>to his knees by a mere sight of a blade bristling with gleaming edges, barbs
<BR>and hooked guards leveled at their chest.
<BR>
<BR>  The Crusader's focus upon the matters of faith and their virtues of Modesty,
<BR>Compassion and Valour not only requires them to forsake personal goals when
<BR>asked for help by those in need, but the Order of Crusades forbids them to
<BR>bask in large number of rare or unique adornments upon their armor.  This 
<BR>severely limits the number of such items they may wear or carry.
