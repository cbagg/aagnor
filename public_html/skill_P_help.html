<BR>  The second defining skill of thieves, the ability to pry allows a skilled

<BR>by first judging the weight as to apply the proper amount of force and
<BR>finesse.
<BR>
<BR>Thus, the &lt;weight&gt; is one's judgement of how heavy the item is, while &lt;object&gt;
<BR>is the item in question.  The thief then begins the careful maneuver of

PATH FOCUS
<BR>
<BR>  As the berserker comes to power in his or her guild, they are required to
<BR>choose a path of focus for their deadly arts of rage and further hone their
<BR>anger towards a certain style.  Three paths are avaliable, and unless chosen,
<BR>the berserker will remain only capable of producing the bland, unfocused
<BR>rage he has used since his birth.  The following paths are possible:
<BR>
<BR>	path of anger
<BR>	path of fury
<BR>	path of devastation
<BR>
<BR>You may gain further help for each skill.
