OGRE OGRES
<BR>
<BR>As strong as many, and much faster, Ogres are in many ways superior to
<BR>the giants they are sometimes mistaken for.  Having similiar frame they
<BR>possess increadible metabolism granting them great strength and speed.
<BR>They heal at an unheard of rate and posses consitution and health that
<BR>far surpasses any other race. This vitality comes at a cost as they are 
<BR>quite vulnerable to magic in all its forms.  While they are unwise and
<BR>foolish at best, they posses suprising intelligence often making ogres
<BR>excelt choice for martial classes such as warrior.  Ogres live in small
<BR>nomadic villages moving often as they forage for food and prey.  The 
<BR>social order is quite undeveloped and thier language skills leave much
<BR>to be desired.  In terms of alignment their race varies, thus all choices 
<BR>are possible.
<BR>
<BR>Ogres can become:
<BR>Warriors, Rangers, and Berserkers.
