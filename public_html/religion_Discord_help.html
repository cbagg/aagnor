DISCORD
<BR>
<BR>You are violent and destructive, a menace to society, and hated by the
<BR>masses.  Your parents never disciplined you as a child, and you've grown up
<BR>to be an irresponsible, violent plague.  You don't like laws or authority in
<BR>general, and you'd rather beat up an innocent child than give money to the
<BR>poor.  
<BR>
<BR>The followers of discord are shunned by most of society, and range from
<BR>petty vandals looking for a cheap thrill to cruel beasts in search of world
<BR>destruction.  They generally resort to violence as a prime solution to all
<BR>problems, and tend to reject unity and balance.
