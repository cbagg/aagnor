TIGER STANCE
<BR>Syntax: tiger
<BR>
<BR>The tiger stance symbolizes the strength and power of the tiger.  While 
<BR>in this stance, the monk imitates the strength and ferocity of the tiger, 
<BR>and attacks with powerful strokes and kicks.  Concentrating on the offensive, 
<BR>the monk neglects his defensive.  Heavy equipment hinders the powerful 
<BR>movements of the tiger stance.  To be as the tiger, you must empower your 
<BR>offenses.
<BR>
<BR>See also EMPOWER, OFFENSIVE.
