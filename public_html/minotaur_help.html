MINOTAUR MINOTAURS
<BR>
<BR>Minotaurs are man-like creatures with the upper torso and the foul temper
<BR>of bulls.  Although they are strong and tough, their unstable temperament
<BR>tends to cloud their thinking and judgment.  As with many beasts, they have
<BR>no true goodness or villainy in them, and thus can only walk the path of
<BR>Balance. They naturally have chaotic tendencies as well.  In addition,
<BR>minotaur berserkers make use of their horns while charging at their opponents 
<BR>for additional damage.
<BR>
<BR>As an innate ability of their race, minotaurs are proficient in the use of
<BR>axes, and can dual wield any two axes without penalty.  They are also easily
<BR>consumed by rage while engaged in combat.  Only the warrior and berserker 
<BR>guild will allow minotaurs to join their ranks.
